Led by their Great Powers, monsters and mages individually capable of leveling a city, they pose a threat that even Kanderon, one of the mightiest of Great Powers, and her equally monstrous allies might be unable to stop. </p> <p>As the Havathi forces push closer and closer to Skyhold, Hugh and his friends train relentlessly, hoping to make a difference in the oncoming siege. While they venture into dangerous realms of untested experimental magic, though, they're already caught up in currents far beyond their control. </p> <p>Once you're a pawn in the games of the Great Powers, there's no escape. </p> <p><i>Let multiple Audie Award-winning voice artist Ralph Lister take you further into the saga of Hugh of Emblin: Don't miss the fifth installment of this epic coming-of-age fantasy.</i></p>";
