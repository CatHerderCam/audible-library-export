window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best seller</b></p> <p><b>A Master Chief story and original full-length novel set in the Halo universe - based on the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling video game series!</b></p> <p>October 2559. It has been a year since the renegade artificial intelligence Cortana issued a galaxy-wide ultimatum, subjecting many worlds to martial law under the indomitable grip of her Forerunner weapons. Outside her view, the members of Blue Team - John-117, the Master Chief; Fred-104; Kelly-087; and Linda-058 - are assigned from the UNSC <i>Infinity</i> to make a covert insertion onto the ravaged planet Reach.</p> <p>Their former home and training ground - and the site of humanity’s most cataclysmic military defeat near the end of the Covenant War - Reach still hides myriad secrets after all these years. Blue Team’s mission is to penetrate the rubble-filled depths of CASTLE Base and recover top-secret assets locked away in Dr. Catherine Halsey’s abandoned laboratory - assets which may prove to be humanity’s last hope against Cortana.</p> <p>But Reach has been invaded by a powerful and ruthless alien faction, who have their own reasons for being there. Establishing themselves as a vicious occupying force on the devastated planet, this enemy will soon transform Blue Team’s simple retrieval operation into a full-blown crisis. And with the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance, mission failure is not an option....</p>";
