Legend has it the faithful ship continues to patrol the empty battlefield, obeying its last order throughout the lonely centuries. </p> <p></p> <p>In the here and now, Earth needs a miracle.

If he fails, the New Men will replace the old. If he succeeds, humanity might just have a fighting chance...</p>";
