It seems to be the only environment in which he excels. However, being a champion Trident Starfighter isn't something you want to brag about in public nor will it help earn a scholarship. </p> <p>But as soon as Austin is about to give up on college he reaches the top of the elite server. He receives an invitation from a school shrouded in secrecy promising to unlock his hidden potential. With no other options, Austin takes the offer. </p> <p>What Austin doesn't realize is that his dream of going to college has just opened up the cosmos and will challenge everything Austin thinks he knows about himself and the universe. </p>";
