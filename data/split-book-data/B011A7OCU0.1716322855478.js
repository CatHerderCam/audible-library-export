After that the UNSC will legally terminate her seven-year existence in order to stave off the threat of the data corruption phenomenon known as \"rampancy\", a condition that will eventually take hold of her functionality and persona, endangering all those around her. In a last-ditch effort to save herself, Iona has successfully launched an unprecedented legal appeal against her own death sentence - a case being watched very closely not only at the highest levels of human government but by others with a very <i>different</i> agenda.... </p>";
