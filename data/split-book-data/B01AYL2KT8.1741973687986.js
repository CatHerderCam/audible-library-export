window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An ancient starship discovered... An eternal enemy revealed... An impossible mission to save humankind. </p> <p>The <i>Goliath</i> has been discovered, the first of its secrets revealed. Now the race is on for Captain Mitchell Williams and his crew to return to Liberty and recover Origin's lost memories before the enemy can complete their violent conquest. It's a mission with a near-zero chance of success. A mission that only the Riggers would be crazy enough to accept - and skilled enough to survive. A mission that will test the limits of Mitchell's mind, body, and soul and force him to make an impossible choice that could cost the lives of millions. This is war, and if he can't win a battle for a single planet, how can he possibly change the outcome of a conflict that has raged beyond eternity? </p>";
