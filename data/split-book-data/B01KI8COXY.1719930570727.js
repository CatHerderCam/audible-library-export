Her latest (failed) attempt to become a superhero has inspired the rest of the kids in her school to reveal their own powers. </p> <p>Now, all of her relationships are changing. She has a not-at-all-secret admirer, who wants to be Penny's partner almost as much as she wants to be Penny's rival. The meanest girl in school has gained super powers and lost her mind. Can Penny help her find a better one? Can she help an aging supervillain connect with his daughter, and mend the broken hearts of two of the most powerful people in the world? And in all this, where will she find time for her own supervillainous fun, or even more dangerous, to start dating? </p> <p>It's going to be a long, strange semester. </p>";
