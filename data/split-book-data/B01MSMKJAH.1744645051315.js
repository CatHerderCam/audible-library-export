window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An original novella set in the Halo Universe and based on the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling video game series! </p> <p>Find. Claim. Profit. </p> <p>In a postwar galaxy littered with scrap, it's the salvager's motto. And with a fast ship and a lust for adventure, Rion Forge has certainly made her mark on the trade. When the discovery of a wrecked UNSC cruiser brings Rion's past back to haunt her, stirring fresh hope into a decades-old wound, she's hell-bent on finding answers: What really happened to her father and his ship, the <i>Spirit of Fire</i>? This novella also contains the complete text of Kelly Gay's short story \"Into the Fire\", originally featured in the collection <i>Halo: Fractures</i>. </p>";
