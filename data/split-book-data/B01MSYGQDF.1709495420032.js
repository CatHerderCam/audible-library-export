window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As the grandson of the alien princess Indigo, Jim (aka Kid Sensation) has always known that, technically, he's royalty. That said, he'd be the first to admit that he's never lived any kind of regal lifestyle - no titles, no castles, no crown jewels. However, the arrival of a courier from his grandmother's home world changes all of that in an instant. By royal edict, Jim is summoned home to the distant planet Caeles in order to claim an alien inheritance. Unfortunately, this is no warm and cuddly family reunion. Caeles is a hotbed of political intrigue, and Jim's arrival has widespread ramifications. Not only are several factions attempting to utilize his very existence as leverage to advance their own agendas, but Jim himself is required to submit to an archaic trial known as a prexetus. Moreover, while some are content with simply trying to use him, it quickly becomes apparent that at least one shadowy individual just wants Jim out of the way - quickly, completely, and permanently. Light years from Earth, with little family and fewer friends, Jim faces the daunting task of finding an enemy whose ultimate purpose is unknown and whose methods are extreme. Complicating matters even further is the fact that Jim's much-heralded super powers are glitching, making him incredibly vulnerable for perhaps the first time in his life. </p>";
