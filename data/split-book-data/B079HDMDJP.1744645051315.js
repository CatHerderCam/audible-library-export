window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Get the first three books in the Kid Sensation series.</p> <p><i>Sensation </i>(Kid Sensation book one)</p> <p>Like millions of other kids, Jim grew up wanting to be a superhero. Unlike most of his contemporaries, however, Jim actually had the goods: a plethora of super powers that would have been the envy of any meta on the planet. But when his tryout with the Alpha League - the world's premiere group of supers - goes disastrously wrong, Jim basically becomes an outcast.</p> <p>Two years later, Jim is still bitter about what happened to him. However, he soon finds himself the centerpiece in an odd turn of events that gives him a second chance at his dream. It’s a lot for one super to handle, even with a smorgasbord of abilities. But if saving the world were easy, everyone would do it....</p> <p><i>Mutation </i>(Kid Sensation book two)</p> <p>Having saved the planet and earned a place with the world’s premiere superhero team, Jim (aka Kid Sensation) is preparing to attend the prestigious Academy, where teen supers from every corner of the globe learn to master their abilities. At the same time, however, he is approached by a mysterious government organization that wants Jim to work for them - and they won’t take no for an answer.</p> <p>Moreover, at the Academy itself, an insidious and highly contagious virus is running amok through the student population, striking at the heart of their abilities. Students are losing control of their powers, with lethal consequences....</p> <p><i>Infiltration </i>(Kid Sensation book three)</p> <p>Having a surfeit of super powers is great for battling bad guys and saving the world, as Jim (aka Kid Sensation) is finding out, but less useful in dealing with day-to-day situations - like bonding with his superhero father, adjusting to a team environment, and coping with what might be perceived as a growing rivalry between himself and another teen super. On top of all that, despite having a serious girlfriend, he finds himself inexplicably drawn to a new female super he’s just met.</p> <p>At the same time, some villain has just gotten himself a new toy: an unknown weapon of tremendous power that is able to strike without warning. It quickly becomes clear that the only way to stop this new evil is from within.</p>";
