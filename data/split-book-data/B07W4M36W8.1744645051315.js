window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book two of the Wolf 359 series.</p> <p>Reveling in the adoration of a nation charmed by their new High Priest, Duncan begins setting the Temple house in order. Unfortunately, his contentment is short lived. Failing to account for a paranoid king jealous of this stranger’s sway over the people, and an entrenched corruption within the Temple - not to mention a scheming senior prelate furious at being denied the high priesthood - Duncan is quickly caught up in the game of power, and just as quickly condemned to die in the wastelands, in the hope that the desert sands will eradicate any memory of the former wizard.</p> <p>With Duncan gone, things begin to get hot for Alexis as the struggle for the throne escalates with each side demanding her allegiance. Instead, she escapes south with the nation’s tarrac, deciding she’d rather carve out her own little kingdom. She has decamped just in time as the armies of the King’s brother descend on the capital, forcing King Diad to secretly escape by ship in an attempt to gather an army from across the sea. Yet no sooner has he set sail than his son proclaims himself king.</p> <p>Yet they all have blindly overlooked another’s ambition, someone who desperately wants to rule Gambria - alone. And she might just pull it off. All she’ll need to do is get rid of her husband and her father....</p>";
