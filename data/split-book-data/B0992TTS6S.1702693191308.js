Rather than being an actual monster.&nbsp;</p> <p>That was Rene’s entire life until a fateful day changed that. Where he died in a mission gone wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>When he met the Watcher in the afterlife, and took on a new life. A life of idyllic bliss that involved having a family.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until he was kidnapped and taken to a new city.
