window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The second book in the legendary&nbsp;series featuring the pilots of Rogue Squadron.</b></p> <p>Sleek, swift, and deadly, they are the X-wing fighters. And as the battle against the Empire rages across the vastness of space, the pilots risk both their lives and their machines for the cause of the Rebel Alliance. Now they must embark on a dangerous espionage mission, braving betrayal and death on the Imperial homeworld to smash the power of a ruthless foe!</p> <p>It is the evil heart of a battered and reeling Empire: Coruscant, the giant city-world from whose massive towers the Imperial High Command directs the war. The Rebels will invade this mighty citadel in a daring move to bring the Empire to its knees. But first Wedge Antilles and his X-wing pilots must infiltrate&nbsp;Coruscant to gain vital intelligence information. Capture means death, or worse—enslavement by the vicious leader known as \"Iceheart,\" Ysanne Isard, now&nbsp;Emperor in all but name. And one of Rogue Squadron's own is already her slave, a traitor hidden behind a mask of innocence, working to betray both colleagues and the Rebellion itself.</p>";
