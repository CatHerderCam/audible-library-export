window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book three of nine.</p> <p>Ash’s life is anything but normal these days.</p> <p>Having discovered his Dao, he’s grown in power. Grown to the point that others are now aware of him and that he could be a danger.</p> <p>In this world of martial arts, only the strong and the ruthless survive. Everyone else is merely a stepping stone on their path of Cultivation or an obstacle to be overcome. Or knocked down. It’s a world where the strong rule and the weak die.</p> <p>Utilizing the Hall, the voice in his head that calls itself Locke, those who have aligned with his faction, and all the powers available to him, Ash has begun his own journey of Cultivation.</p> <p>Except that as a Fated One, his journey is a narrow and winding path between two cosmic forces. Each one vying for dominance.</p> <p>That doesn’t even take into account the royal family or the Realm Lord.</p> <p>This is his third step in his life as a Cultivator.</p> <p>Overcoming his first tribulation and solidifying his Dantian.</p>";
