What she didn’t expect was for the mastermind of her plight to survive, as well as do her a favor: She removed her from the Arcology, and enrolled her in the GroCorp corporate college. She knows the Arcology, but this is a chance to earn enough credits to set her family up for life.</p> <p>But people are disappearing, and betrayal lurks around every corner. Kat is out of her depth, and everyone is playing for keeps. Only by relying on every erg of power she’s managed to scavenge from the Tower of Somnus does Kat even begin to stand a chance.</p> <p>What if the power she earns comes at a price that isn’t hers to pay?</p>";
