A daughter who will not wait for rescue.</b></p> <p>The bounty for bringing down a major crime syndicate may have removed Captain Evridiki “EB” Bardacki’s immediate financial needs, but no freighter captain wants to fly empty between the stars. A cargo mission to run a blockade seems within his crew’s unique mix of talents, and he agrees to supply weapons to one side of a stalemated civil war in the Estutmost star system.</p> <p>The sudden collapse of the stalemate puts EB on the wrong side of the front lines from his adopted daughter. He took down a crime syndicate to protect her once—what’s a planetary military or two?</p>";
