window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Two centuries ago, the First Expansionary Fleet set off to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, hoping to explore, colonize, and conquer new worlds in the name of humanity. But when the fleet was violently and unexpectedly thrown off course, the colonists found themselves trapped in an unexplored region of the galaxy—and caught right in the middle of a bloody interstellar war.</p> <p>Now, after generations of relentless fighting, a tentative truce has finally ushered in an era of growth and prosperity. Yet as hardline forces on all sides conspire to break the ceasefire, humanity finds itself in need of a new type of soldier—one who can win the peace even while the galaxy arms for war.</p> <p>Major Kal Zeris is the next generation of Dominion trooper, a powerful psionic soldier capable of withstanding—and dishing out—superhuman amounts of punishment. Born naturally on a crime-infested border world, Kal has learned to do whatever it takes to survive. But when he finds himself paired up with a sheltered young fleet cadet, he quickly learns that despite what her flawless, genetically engineered body may have given her in looks and smarts, there is no replacement for good, old-fashioned experience—on the battlefield. And luckily for her, Kal is eager and willing to help.</p> <p>Together, they must unravel a conspiracy that threatens to end the peace—and destroy the Lost Fleet before it can find its way home.</p> <p><i>Incursion</i> is the first installment in The Lost Fleet trilogy, an action-packed power fantasy in the spirit of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>,<i> Mass Effect</i>, and <i>Star Trek</i> (the good version).</p>";
