window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When the Fafnir responds to a desperate distress call, their act of kindness is turned against them, making Van the most wanted man in the known universe.</b></p> <p>Targeted by a vicious, charismatic politician and his shadowy partner, Van and his friends are faced with a decision that carries long term consequences—deliver justice...or run and hide.</p> <p>The choice is easy. The Fafnir will attack, and criminals will pay regardless of the bounty chasing them across the stars.</p> <p>But first, there’s a little business to take care of in the form of a social event at Milon Estates. Dress is formal, the atmosphere tense, and a choice must be made. And just like Van’s decision to fight, the event on Helso will change his life forever.</p> <p>The crew is willing, and the ship is ready. Now, all Van has to do is avoid the law, apply the law, and dive headfirst into a conspiracy that will play out on the largest stage of all: The Galaxy itself.</p> <p>Experience the seventh entry in the ongoing Backyard Starship series from <i>USA Today</i> bestsellers J.N. Chaney and Terry Maggert. Buckle up and grab your juicebox, because it's time to get out there and save the Galaxy.</p>";
