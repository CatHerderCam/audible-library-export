window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The world waits for no one. While Boxxy is off chasing shinies and delving dungeons abroad, Azurvale's shadows churn, fester, and ferment into a potent cocktail of trouble. Secret organizations maneuver behind the scenes, patiently advancing their nefarious plots. Government agencies lay in wait, ready to pounce at the first sign of trouble. Powerful adventurers gear up and train for the next challenge, uncertain as to what form it might take. In the midst of all this, a humble scholar arrives from a distant land wholly ignorant to the mountain-sized powder keg waiting for him. Explosives primed and the fuse set, the only thing missing is a spark to set things off, and who better to serve that role than a fiery redhead making her triumphant return?</p> <p>It would appear that the universe once again conspires to put the Hero of Chaos in dire straits. However, in this particular instance, Boxxy is not entirely without fault. It doesn't know it yet, but the nasty surprises that await it are nothing more than the consequences of its own actions. As it turns out, butting heads with the seedy underbelly of civilized society has a way of stirring up an immense amount of trouble. Boxxy is aware of this, of course, though it doesn't care since it fancies itself an expert at deflecting blame and avoiding responsibility. For the most part, this is an accurate assessment. Unfortunately for the less-than-a-year-old monster, it has yet to learn one of life's key lessons.</p> <p>Bad karma is like a stubborn stainâ€”it never truly goes away.</p> <p><b>Content warning</b>: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content</p>";
