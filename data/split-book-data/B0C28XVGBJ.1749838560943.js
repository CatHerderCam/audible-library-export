In its pursuit, they headed toward the Demon Continent, checking on Grea and Tina on their way to the coast. Receiving a request from Guildmaster Suanori to take a look at the port town Nebula during their departure, Ast's party arrived right in front of it just to notice something unusual from the distance....</p> <p>Asterios and his friends might learn that Guildmaster Suanori's worry isn't completely unfounded as they dive straight into a conflict none of them could have expected. Will they be able to push through all of them and reach their final destination safely? Will they require the help of a new summon or someone even more powerful to solve them? What even is the nature of the issue troubling Nebula?</p> <p>They are soon going to see for themselves.</p>";
