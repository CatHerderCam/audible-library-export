Her inscriptions have been renewed and completed, granting her newfound power that she must learn to control, and she has a long list of tasks to complete before she can join the ranks of the powerful Archons.<br> <br> As she delves deeper into the mysteries of the world, barely even hinted at by the Academy, Tala has discovered the secrets of the truly mighty: the creation of an Archon Star. The Mage isn't content to follow the standard path.
