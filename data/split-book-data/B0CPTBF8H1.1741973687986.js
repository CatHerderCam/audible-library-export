window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The nonstop action and antics continue—and the hero-sidekick relationship is turned on its head—in the second installment of this thrilling fantasy series.</b></p> <p>When quiet Orrin and his extroverted best friend, Daniel, were transported to a strange RPG-based world, not much changed between them. Daniel became a hero of legend, while Orrin remained his unobtrusive shadow. Only when they faced a particularly lethal foe did Orrin step out of his comfort zone and display his true worth—with powers he didn't know he had. Of course, Daniel got all the glory, but Orrin doesn't mind. He's just happy they're both still alive.</p> <p>However, they are given little time to celebrate before a local authority offers them the chance to explore a newly revealed dungeon. They can hardly refuse, as the adventure would bring them within spitting distance of the woodland realm of the elves, which is currently enduring an attack by the neighboring country of Odrana. So Daniel and Orrin hope to get stronger conquering the dungeon and then lend a hand in the war.</p> <p>And though he's not typical warrior material, Orrin has his own set of magical skills to bring to the quest. Skills he's surprised to learn shouldn't even exist. And for good reason: it seems his ever-growing abilities have the potential to elevate him far beyond his bestie the hero . . .</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than 600,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
