window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A determined young woman struggles to uncover the secrets of the System itself—before the unthinkable happens—as this LitRPG adventure continues.</b></p> <p>Transported from Earth to an entirely new planet, filled with magic and monsters, Alice Verianna has not only had to figure out how to survive but to learn and grow while she's at it. But what's really driven her from the time of her arrival is the desire to investigate—and determine the true nature of—the seemingly omnipotent System that holds sway over all things in the world of Luliv.</p> <p>Alice takes a major leap forward when she finds a patron researcher who helps her gain admittance to magic school, where she gets to study everything from self-defense to monster biology. But the more she advances both academically and personally, the more she suspects something might be wrong with the System itself...</p> <p>Adding to the danger and darkness, the enigmatic Society of Starry Eyes has been working in the shadows, conducting experiments with broken mana and human beings—to horrifying results. With the Society growing ever bolder and the land on the precipice of disaster, can Alice discover what's wrong with the System before it's too late?</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
