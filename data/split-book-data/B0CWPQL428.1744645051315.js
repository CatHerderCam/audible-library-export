Smoulder was waiting for me, the little doom-bunny having missed me almost as much as I missed her. Turns out she's been tagging along with a figure straight out of Akilo's legends, the warrior Queen Uthica. While helping said legend with her quest, I thrive under her tutelage, bringing my spells to a whole new level.</p> <p>Which is exactly what I need. Because if I want to return to escape the past, I'll need to swim through time with the best of them or risk being lost beneath <i>The Temporal Tides</i>.</p>";
