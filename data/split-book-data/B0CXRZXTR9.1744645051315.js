window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When an ambitious teenage girl from Earth finds herself in a magical realm, she </b><b><i>could</i></b><b> be the hero—but she'd prefer to be the villain.</b></p> <p>When power-hungry Everly is reborn into a medieval world where elemental magic rules and she receives her elemental servants—the oddly sadistic Eris and the fun-loving Titania—years earlier than one typically would, she knows she's destined for a command of necromantic magic the likes of which her peers can only dream.</p> <p>Though she's the bastard daughter of a count and a precariously positioned concubine, Everly is determined to be a conqueror, warlord, and queen. She could be the hero of the realm, the person to save everyone, with her protectors—the Silver Lance—and her beautiful mage lover by her side.</p> <p>But Everly's no hero. She's an aspiring villain, seeking the freedom that comes with doing wrong. And before long, she'll make everyone fear the name of the Empress . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit portal fantasy series—with more than 400,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
