window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Kat achieved what she wanted. It put a target on her back. She can only hope to dodge the bullet.</b><br> <br> Kat paid for her position with blood. Hers, and from those who stood in her way. Now, she has finally climbed to a spot where she has real power; she can improve things the way she thinks is necessary. But power isn't as simple as she thought it would be. It comes with complications and obligations that stop her from taking action and enemies that don't like to share their authority.<br> <br> While Kat may be one of the strongest humans alive, physical and magical strength hasn't prepared her to deal with the politics and backstabbing that can end her life just as quickly as a knife in a back alley. With the tables turned, she has to fend off the same tactics she used to get into her position: infiltrators and samurai are gunning for Kat on the orders of her political rivals.<br> <br> In a race against time, Kat must unmask her enemies before her friends and family pay the blood price</p>";
