If that wasn't enough, though, he still had the wild hunt hanging over his head. Seven days to go, and then he'd be thrown into whatever twisted event the system had cooked up for him. The only good thing was that he had those seven days to train. He might not be the highest leveled of the Forerunners, but his mentor made sure he had the best foundation. He could only grow stronger from here.</p>";
