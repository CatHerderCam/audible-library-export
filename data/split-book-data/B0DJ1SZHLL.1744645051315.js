window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Trapped in a world of monsters and magic, survival is just the beginning.</p> <p>When Evelyn moves to Monterey Bay for college, she expects her biggest challenges to be making new friends and surviving freshman year. But her life takes a dark and unexpected turn when she's abducted and thrust into a terrifying world of monsters, magic, and ancient secrets.</p> <p>After awakening in an unfamiliar body and with a collar around her neck, Evelyn must use her wits, a positive attitude, and a spark of newfound magic to escape cultists, dodge undead horrors, and—with a bit of luck, find a way back to civilization. Unsure of who to trust and clinging to the hope of returning home, she must navigate a landscape where danger both physical and political lurks around every corner. What begins as a quest to survive becomes a journey of self-discovery, revealing a resilience she never knew she had.</p>";
