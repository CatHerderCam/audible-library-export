window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A zero-turned-hero continues his action-packed journey to greatness through a world of magic and mayhem in this exciting LitRPG fantasy series.</b></p> <p>On Earth, the scrawny Orrin may have been a big nothing, but he had a bigger buddy in his athletic bestie, Daniel. They were inseparable, like two sides of the same coin. But when a tragic accident transported them to an RPG-like reality, that coin got seriously flipped.</p> <p>At first, Daniel was the natural-born hero, and Orrin the dead weight. But Orrin found himself growing beyond the role of sidekick, gaining powers no one had ever heard of. Genuine hero stuff.</p> <p>Alas, trying to be a hero is how he ended up a prisoner of the ruler of Odrana, and his even more conniving mother, Anabella, who sees potential in Orrin as a political pawn. All Orrin has to do to gain his freedom is infiltrate an elite magical academy, make friends with some very influential students, and help maneuver Anabella back into power.</p> <p>Unfortunately, school in this realm is pretty much the same as school on Earth—albeit with less bullying and more attempted murder. Now, Orrin's only hope is for Daniel to somehow find him and do what he does best: <i>Save Orrin's ass.</i></p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than 600,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
