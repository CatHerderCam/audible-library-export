window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After narrowly escaping the sacrificial alter, Evelyn finds herself trapped in a labyrinth of tunnels deep underground. Lost, injured, and separated from her friends, she begins a new journey that will drag her into a conflict that she hadn't known existed, lead her to uncover the side of history that has been hidden from her, and finally begin to understand her new life and the world she has become a part of. None of this will come easy, however. Choosing a her way forward is clouded by the trauma and shame that haunt her every thought, the heartbreak over the death of her friend, and her desire for revenge. It does not help that her injuries in both body and soul force her to stay in her natural fox form while she heals. First things first. She will need help if she is going to escape the tunnels and find her way back home - but making allies becomes a new challenge while lacking the ability to speak.</p>";
