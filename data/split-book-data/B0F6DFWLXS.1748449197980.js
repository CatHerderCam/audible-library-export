In the waning city of Alefast, where potent threats are gathering faster than ever before, Tala begins to fill in the gaps in her knowledge and learn of the potential consequences of her immortality. As she confronts the harsh realities of her existence, she must forge her own path and find meaning in a life that stretches endlessly before her.</p> <p>Beyond questions of existence, her unique magics and relentless training have left her craving worthy opponents and a sense of purpose. With new friends—and powerful foes—her own immortal life as a Defender of Humanity has just begun.</p>";
