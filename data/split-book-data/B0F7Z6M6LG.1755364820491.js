window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With Light and Shadow completing the Path of Ascension, three foreign Great Powers equal to the Empire in power have declared war. Thankfully they aren't alone but with only one ally in their corner their best hope is to fight for a close loss. That is unless they can produce another miracle Ascender in time to turn the tides of war.<br> <br> Can Matt, Liz, and Aster do what it takes to reach Tier 25 and finish the Path in time? Will it be enough?<br> <br> <b>Don't miss Book 9 of this action-packed fantasy adventure that blends everything you love about LitRPG with Xianxia.</b><br> <br> <b>About the series:</b> <i>This is a mix between LitRPG and Xianxia. It's like a car that looks like a LitRPG with dungeons and skills, but the interior and engine are all Xianxia. It features a magic system and progression system that are logically and internally consistent, as well as realistic fight scenes and a rational MC.</i></p>";
